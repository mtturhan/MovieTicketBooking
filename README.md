# MovieTicketBooking
**Movie ticket booking project with Java in IntellijIdea and MySql** <br>
***Hello everyone. It is a project written in Java language in IntellijIdea and database created using MySql.***
## Operation of the application:
1. We want the user who wants to buy movie tickets to register first.  
2. The registered user needs to login and this requires 'identify number' and 'password' as stated in the code.
3. There is only one last step left for the logged-in user to buy a movie ticket, and that is: choosing the movie and the seat he/she will sit in.
